  <p>
    Library for enhancing Micro applications with REST functionality, Bearer Token Parsing, and JSON Interpretation.
    Includes Dynamic Validation Processing to make JWT extensible.  This is not a fully baked Micro Application, but rather a set of tools to enable additional out-of-the-box functionality for your own micro applications.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Installation

**Git:**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/SageITSolutions/phalcon-rest.git
```

**Composer:**

```sh
composer require sageit/phalcon-rest
```

<br />

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Implementing a Service
This project consists of prebuild services that simply need to be added to DI for services.
JWT assumes the presense of a config object in the DI with a JWT section. This can also be passed as a named array in the constructor, but the provided JWT service does not utilize this.

**Config Register**

One option is to have your application iterate services listed in the config object and register them

```yaml
services:
  tools: Phalcon\Di\Service\Common\Tools
  request: Phalcon\Di\Service\Request\Json
  response: Phalcon\Di\Service\Response\Json
  jwt: Phalcon\Di\Service\Encryption\Security\JWT\Jwt
```

```php
foreach ($config->services as $service => $class) {
  $di->register(new $class);
}
```

**Register Manually**

```php
$di->register(new \Phalcon\Di\Service\Common\Tools());
$di->register(new \Phalcon\Di\Service\Request\Json());
$di->register(new \Phalcon\Di\Service\Response\Json());
$di->register(new \Phalcon\Di\Service\Encryption\Security\JWT\Jwt());
```
